# Text-Classification-with-Python-Project

## Background Information<br />
You work as a Computational Linguist for a Global firm, collaborating with Engineers and
Researchers in Assistant and Research & Machine Intelligence to develop language
understanding models that improve our ability to understand and generate natural
language.<br />

## Problem Statement<br />
You have been tasked to build a text language classification system that classifies a
given input as written in English or in Dutch.<br />

## Dataset<br />
You have been provided with the following dataset that contains over 1000 examples of
around 15 words segments along with a class specifying if the words in the example are
written in English or Dutch. Each record begins with a two letter class code describing
the class to which the following record belongs i.e. "en" - stands for English and "nl" -
stands for Dutch.<br />
All the words of a record belong only to one class. There is no record that contains some
words belonging to "en" and others belonging to "nl".<br />
